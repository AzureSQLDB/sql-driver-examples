**Get Connection Information**

1. Get the connection string info from the Azure Portal

Go to your database and look in the panel on the left.  It should say Overview, activity log, â€¦

Under the settings subcategory, look for connection strings:

![ConnectionStringMenu]({{ baseurl }}/assets/images/ConnectionStringOnMenu.png)

2. Click Connection Strings, and then take note of the information:  

 ```results
Server=tcp:your_server.database.windows.net,1433;Initial Catalog=your_database;Persist Security Info=False;User ID=your_user ;Password=<THIS IS ACTUALLY NOT RETURNED>;MultipleActiveResultSets=False;Encrypt=True;TrustServerCertificate=False;Connection Timeout=30;
 ```

3. Make a note of the following somewhere for reference in subsequent steps:

 ```results
Server=your_server.database.windows.net

Database=your_database

UserId=your_user

Password=your_password
```

1.  From the server, in the search bar at the top, type "firewall", and select "Firewalls and virtual networks".
1.  In the bar at the top, you sould see three shortcut options: Save, Discard, and + Add Client IP.  Click on + Add Client IP.
1.  Next click Save.  You can close this view now.
