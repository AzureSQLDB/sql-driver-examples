Note! With the introduction of Service Pack 1 for SQL Server 2016, features in the database engine related to application development are now available across all editions of SQL Server (from Express through Enterprise). This includes innovations that can significantly improve your applicationâ€™s throughput, latency, and security. Examples include the in-memory columnstore used in this tutorial, in-memory OLTP, data compression, table partitioning, Hadoop integration with PolyBase, Always Encrypted, row-level security, and data masking. Enjoy!
