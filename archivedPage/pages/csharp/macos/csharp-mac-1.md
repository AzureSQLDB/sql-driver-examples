> In this section, you will get SQL Server 2017 on Docker. After that you will install the necessary dependencies to create .NET Core apps with SQL Server.

## Step 1.1 Install SQL Server

{% include partials/install_sql_server_mac.md %}

## Step 1.2 Install Homebrew and .NET Core SDK

If you already have .NET Core SDK installed on your machine, skip this step.

Install .NET Core by downloading the **[official installer](https://download.visualstudio.microsoft.com/download/pr/fff497aa-e6f6-4556-b67b-d139e772156f/4efa99b6bf0cb59104920dfd5f65f8a8/dotnet-sdk-3.1.302-osx-x64.pkg)**. This installer will install the tools and put them on your PATH so you can run dotnet from the Console.

> You have successfully installed .NET Core on your Mac. You now have everything you need to start writing your C# apps with SQL Server!
