# Authoring in GitHub

If you're unfamiliar with Git, you might want to review some Git terminology: [https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary). In addition, this StackOverflow thread contains a glossary of Git terms you'll encounter here: [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7076164/terminology-used-by-git](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7076164/terminology-used-by-git)

## Modify articles using the GitHub UI

### Submit a text-only change to an existing article
If you only need or want to make textual updates to an existing article, you probably don't need to follow the rest of the steps. You can use GitHub's web-based markdown editor to submit your changes. 

1. Click the Edit button on the article page you want to modify.

2. Then, click the edit icon in the GitHub version of the article (pencil icon at top right corner).

 That opens the easy-to-use web editor that makes it easy to submit changes. You don't need to follow the other steps in this article.

### All other changes
The GitHub UI does support creation of new files and dragging and dropping images. However, when you work in the UI, managing branches can be confusing so we typically recommend you install the tools and learn the commands for creating and managing articles. If you want to use the UI, see:
