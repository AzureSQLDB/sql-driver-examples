> In this section you will create a simple Python app. The Python app will perform basic Insert, Update, Delete, and Select.

## Step 2.1 Get Connection Information to use in Connection Strings, and Create a Firewall Rule.

{% include partials/get_azure_sql_connection_info.md %}

## Step 2.2 Create a Python app that connects to Azure SQL and executes queries

Create a new folder for the sample

```terminal
mkdir AzureSqlSample
cd AzureSqlSample
```

Execute the T-SQL scripts below in the terminal with sqlcmd to a table and insert some row.

```terminal
sqlcmd -S your_server.database.windows.net -U your_user -P your_password -d your_database -Q "CREATE TABLE Employees (Id INT IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, Name NVARCHAR(50), Location NVARCHAR(50));"
sqlcmd -S your_server.database.windows.net -U your_user -P your_password -d your_database -Q "INSERT INTO Employees (Name, Location) VALUES (N'Jared', N'Australia'), (N'Nikita', N'India'), (N'Tom', N'Germany');"
```

Using your favorite text editor, create a new file called crud.py in the AzureSqlSample folder. Paste the code below inside into the new file and update the connection information. This will insert, update, delete, and read a few rows.

```python
import pyodbc
server = 'your_server.database.windows.net'
database = 'your_database'	
username = 'your_user'
password = 'your_password'
cnxn = pyodbc.connect('DRIVER={ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server};SERVER='+server+';DATABASE='+database+';UID='+username+';PWD='+ password)
cursor = cnxn.cursor()

print ('Inserting a new row into table')
#Insert Query
tsql = "INSERT INTO Employees (Name, Location) VALUES (?,?);"
with cursor.execute(tsql,'Jake','United States'):
    print ('Successfully Inserted!')


#Update Query
print ('Updating Location for Nikita')
tsql = "UPDATE Employees SET Location = ? WHERE Name = ?"
with cursor.execute(tsql,'Sweden','Nikita'):
    print ('Successfully Updated!')


#Delete Query
print ('Deleting user Jared')
tsql = "DELETE FROM Employees WHERE Name = ?"
with cursor.execute(tsql,'Jared'):
    print ('Successfully Deleted!')


#Select Query
print ('Reading data from table')
tsql = "SELECT Name, Location FROM Employees;"
with cursor.execute(tsql):
    row = cursor.fetchone()
    while row:
        print (str(row[0]) + " " + str(row[1]))
        row = cursor.fetchone()
```

Run your Python script from the terminal.

```terminal
python crud.py
```

```results
Inserting a new row into table
Successfully Inserted!
Updating Location for Nikita
Successfully Updated!
Deleting user Jared
Successfully Deleted!
Reading data from table
Jake United States
```

## Step 2.3 Secure your credentials using Azure Key Vault


**Create an Azure Key Vault and put your Secret into it.**

{% include partials/create_key_vault_and_store_creds.md %}


** Install the python libraries**

The reference documentation about the python sdk for Azure can be found [**here.**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/overview/azure/key-vault?view=azure-python)

1. Execute the following from an Administrator command window:

```terminal 
pip install azure-keyvault-secrets 
pip install azure-keyvault-keys
pip install azure-keyvault-certificates
pip install azure-identity
```

**Set up your environment to Authenticate to Azure Key Vault**

This section takes you through the steps described [**on this site**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/secrets/quick-create-python) to set up your machine for authentication to the key vault.  You need to do this to use the **DefaultAzureCredentialBuilder()**.

1. Open a command window and execute **az login** if you have not already.
1. Create a service prinicpal (make sure you take note of the output, as you will use it in the next two steps.):

```terminal
az ad sp create-for-rbac -n "http://mySP" --sdk-auth
```

1. Give the serpvice prinicpal access to your key vault.

```terminal
az keyvault set-policy -n <your-unique-keyvault-name> --spn <clientId-of-your-service-principal> --secret-permissions delete get list set --key-permissions create decrypt delete encrypt get list unwrapKey wrapKey
```

1. Set environment variables.  You can do this from the command line in the following way:

```terminal
setx AZURE_CLIENT_ID <your_client_id>
setx AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET <your_client_secret>
setx AZURE_TENANT_ID <your_tenantID>
```

**Update your crud.py to use the Key Vault for Authentication** 


Copy the following into your crud.py, replacing the old, and being sure to update your connection information and your keyvault name:

```python
import pyodbc
server = 'your_server.database.windows.net'
database = 'your_database'
username = 'your_user'

from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.keyvault.secrets import SecretClient

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

secret_client = SecretClient(vault_url="https://<your_keyvault_name>.vault.azure.net", credential=credential)

# NOTE: please replace the ("<your-secret-name>") with the name of the secret in your vault
secret = secret_client.get_secret("AppSecret")

password = secret.value

cnxn = pyodbc.connect('DRIVER={ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server};SERVER='+server+';DATABASE='+database+';UID='+username+';PWD='+ password)
cursor = cnxn.cursor()


print ('Inserting a new row into table')
#Insert Query
tsql = "INSERT INTO Employees (Name, Location) VALUES (?,?);"
with cursor.execute(tsql,'Jake','United States'):
    print ('Successfully Inserted!')


#Update Query
print ('Updating Location for Nikita')
tsql = "UPDATE Employees SET Location = ? WHERE Name = ?"
with cursor.execute(tsql,'Sweden','Nikita'):
    print ('Successfully Updated!')


#Delete Query
print ('Deleting user Jared')
tsql = "DELETE FROM Employees WHERE Name = ?"
with cursor.execute(tsql,'Jared'):
    print ('Successfully Deleted!')


#Select Query
print ('Reading data from table')
tsql = "SELECT Name, Location FROM Employees;"
with cursor.execute(tsql):
    row = cursor.fetchone()
    while row:
        print (str(row[0]) + " " + str(row[1]))
        row = cursor.fetchone()
```

Then run again:

```terminal
python crud.py
```
