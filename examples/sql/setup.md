To run the SQL Server examples, you will need the following:

1. A SQL Server database. This can be a developer version downloaded [here](https://www.microsoft.com/sql-server/sql-server-downloads) and installed locally or it can be running in a [container](https://learn.microsoft.com/sql/linux/quickstart-install-connect-docker?view=sql-server-ver16&pivots=cs1-bash).
1. VS Code which can be downloaded from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
1. Access to a user with the db_owner role who can create databases and objects within those database.
