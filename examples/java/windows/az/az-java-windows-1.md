> In this section, you create an Azure Hosted SQL Database. After that you will install the necessary dependencies to create .NET Framework apps with Azure SQL. 

## Step 1.1 Create Azure Hosted SQL Database

{% include partials/setup_azure_sql_instance.md %}

## Step 1.2 Install Java

If you already have Java installed on your machine, skip the next three steps.

Install the **Java Long-terms supoort for Azure** by following the steps below.

1. Download and install Java from [**Microsoft's Java Support Page**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/java/azure/jdk/java-jdk-install?view=azure-java-stable)
2.  Check your Java install worked by opening a command window and typing the following command.

```terminal
  Java --version
```

## 1.3 Install Maven

[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) can be used to help manage dependencies, build, test and run your Java project. Follow the instructions below to install Maven.

1. Download the [Maven binary](https://downloads.apache.org/maven/maven-3/3.6.3/binaries/apache-maven-3.6.3-bin.zip)
2. Unzip the installer to a file location on your computer

Add the Maven bin directory to your PATH environment variable and add the JRE to the JAVA_HOME environment variable

1. Press start 
2. Search for "Advanced System Settings" 
3. Click on the "Environment Variables" button 
4. Add the location of the bin folder of the Maven installation to the PATH variable in **System Variables**. The following is a typical value for the PATH variable: C:\WINDOWS\system32;C:\WINDOWS;C:\Maven\bin
5. Create a new System Variable for "JAVA_HOME" and point it to the JDK folder (ex. C:\Program Files\Zulu-11)
6. Check that Maven was installed properly by opening a new command window (to refresh the variables), and then running the following command.

```terminal
  mvn --version
```

```results
Apache Maven 3.6.3 (cecedd343002696d0abb50b32b541b8a6ba2883f)
